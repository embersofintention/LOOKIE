# How It Basically Works

* Content managed in Obsidian vault, LOOKIE (this)
* Push to GitHub
* Repo on Github fires off an Action that connects with the Site repo, LOOKIESITE; updates a submodule with most recent LOOKIE vault content
* an Action in the LOOKIESITE repo uses Kiln, a static site generator, to create a website and post to GitHub Pages
