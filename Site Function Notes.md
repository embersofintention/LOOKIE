...or dysfunction notes more accurately 



# General Things
that apply regardless of sync method



# When using Gitless Sync to update Vault

* images don't seem to work unless I rename them in obsidian after adding them.  No idea why. 
* site seems to appear broken for a minute or so after it updates, with the layout jumbled.  Refreshing after a minute seems to fix it though. 
* sync seems to crash if any files are deleted from the vault.  I'll have to look into this.

## Images
I dragged and dropped each of these from the "attachments" folder in the vault, right here within obsidian.  Each was done (and synced to the site) when the vault's settings were set to use its type of link.

-- This one uses "shortest link when possible"

![[attachments/ralien sticker weirdface.png]] 
This one uses -- "from vault folder"

**This one doesn't seem to work** so it seems we need to use "path from shortest link possible"

## Links
trying to test this now...
