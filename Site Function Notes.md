# General Things
that apply regardless of sync method



# When using Gitless Sync to update Vault

* images don't seem to work unless I rename them in obsidian after adding them.  No idea why. 
* site seems to appear broken for a minute or so after it updates, with the layout jumbled.  Refreshing after a minute seems to fix it though. 
* sync seems to crash if any files are deleted from the vault.  I'll have to look into this.

## Testing methods of linking to stuff

![[ralien sticker weirdface.png]] -- "shortest link when possible"

![[attachments/ralien sticker weirdface.png]] -- "from vault folder"
[[Site Function Notes]]
**Neither of these seem to work** so it seems we need to use "path from shortest link possible"
